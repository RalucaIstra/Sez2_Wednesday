Overview

This C++ program serves as a film production cost calculator, incorporating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The program covers various aspects such as actor selection, menu planning, transportation, and accommodation. It reads and manipulates data from CSV files, generates random actor names and roles, and calculates costs for different production periods.

Features

    Actor Generation:
        Generates random actor names and assigns roles based on a predefined set of characters.

    Menu Planning:
        Randomly generates menus for a specified number of days, catering to different dietary preferences.

    Cost Calculation:
        Calculates costs for transportation, accommodation, makeup, food, water, coffee, juice, and space rental for different production periods.

    Object-Oriented Design:
        Utilizes classes and objects to encapsulate data and behaviors, promoting code modularity and reusability.
        Demonstrates inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism through classes like Cast, Actori, Personal, and Transport.

    Data Input/Output:
        Reads actors' information, menu details, and cost breakdowns from CSV files.
        Writes calculated costs to the "cost2.csv" file.

Files

    main.cpp: Contains the main logic and execution of the program.
    wednesdayCast.csv: Initial data file containing actor names and roles.
    masa.csv: Menu data file.
    cost2.csv: Output file containing the calculated costs.

Usage

    Compile: Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
    Run: Execute the compiled program.
    Output: The program generates cost breakdowns in the "cost2.csv" file for different production periods.

Dependencies

    C++ Compiler: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed to build and run the program.
